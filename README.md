# Getting Started

## What is Wisdom Curated?

Searching for relevant information on the internet is broken. Wisdom Curated is an experiment to gather people obsessed by an idea, and have them tell us the relevant information.

I am starting out by asking subject-matter-experts to curate information about their respective fields.

## How is the information delivered?

Each topic will have atleast one person who will curate information on a weekly basis. Again, we do not want 10 blue links, the goal is to get to highest quality information quickly.

Each update will have commentary from the expert, maybe an interview with someone in the field and a list of resources. That list will be published here in the library.

## How can I suggest topics?

You can either **fill the survey\(recommended\) or** email me admin@wisdomcurated.com 

## Who is behind this?

Hey there! I am [Naveen](https://twitter.com/_naveenmishra). I have spent way too much time on the internet.

## Will it cost me anything?

This library will always be free for all to access. 

Going forward, if there is demand, I may produce more specialized content that will be paid for by the readers. Like detailed reports, time-based analysis etc. But its all up in the air for now.
