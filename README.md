#### **What is Wisdom Curated ?**

Wisdom Curated is an experiment to curate the best resources around a particular topic. Think of this as a blend of Wikipedia, Product Hunt and Awesome Lists.

#### What are the goals here?

Curate wisdom around a topic that is

* Actionable
* Timely
* Concise
* Available to everyone

#### Template

For each topic, Information should be grouped as follows.

* Articles
* Books
* Podcasts
* People
* Interesting Projects
* Videos
* Other

#### Who is behind this?

I am [Naveen](https://twitter.com/_naveenmishra), I believe that curation and access to the right information will be immensely valuable. This is my attempt to build a community of people interested in doing this.

#### Future

As interest in this project grows, I plan to add communities for each topic, with video calls and have version control of all the data.
